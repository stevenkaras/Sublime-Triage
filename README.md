# Triage for SublimeText 3

This package provides syntax highlighting for a simple todo-list format I use.


## Installation - [Package Control][package-control]

I don't expect this to be a popular package, so it won't be added to Package Control unless I see there's demand for it.

[package-control]: https://sublime.wbond.net/

## Installation - Manual

1. Locate Preferences in the menu, click on "Browse Packages..."
2. Clone this repo into your Packages folder

    git clone http://github.com/stevenkaras/Sublime-Triage.git

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome.

These are good ideas of things to start helping out with:

- helper command to resolve the currently selected issue (based on cursor position)
- helper to print the current date in yyyymmdd format
